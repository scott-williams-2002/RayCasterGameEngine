# RayCasterGameEngine
Still a work in progress but currently has the capabilities to edit a map and represent the map in a pseudo-3D representation using a variation of the ray-casting algorithm use in the Doom video game. This project uses the SFML c++ graphics library, but will be updated in the future to use a higher performance/ more professional 
library.
